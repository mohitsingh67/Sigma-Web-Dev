//How a Website Works?
A website is a collection of web pages that are accessed through a browser using the internet. It follows a client-server architecture where:

User (Client) requests a webpage by entering a URL.

Server processes the request and sends the required files (HTML, CSS, JS, images, etc.).

Browser renders the webpage and displays it to the user.

User interacts with the website (clicks, fills forms, etc.), sending new requests to the server.

///Introduction to MERN Stack
MERN Stack is a JavaScript-based technology stack used to build full-stack web applications. It consists of:

MongoDB â€“ NoSQL Database (Stores data in JSON-like format)

Express.js â€“ Backend framework (Handles server logic & APIs)

React.js â€“ Frontend library (Builds dynamic user interfaces)

Node.js â€“ JavaScript runtime (Executes server-side code)

How MERN Works?

React.js (Frontend) sends requests to the backend.

Express.js + Node.js (Backend) processes requests and interacts with MongoDB.

MongoDB (Database) stores and retrieves data as needed.

MERN allows developers to build scalable and interactive full-stack applications using JavaScript for both frontend and backend. ğŸš€
